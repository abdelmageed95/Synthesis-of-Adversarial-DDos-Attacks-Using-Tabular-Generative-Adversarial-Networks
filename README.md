Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are tools or software that are widely used to maintain the computer
networks and information systems keeping them secure and preventing malicious traffics from penetrating into them, as
they flag when somebody is trying to break into the system. Best effort has been set up on these systems, and the results achieved
so far are quite satisfying, however, new types of attacks stand out as the technology of attacks keep evolving, one of these
attacks are the attacks based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) that can evade machine learning IDS leaving
them vulnerable.
This project investigates the impact of the Adversarial Attacks synthesized using real DDos attacks generated using
GANs on the IDS. The objective is to discover how will these systems react towards synthesized attacks. marking the
vulnerability and weakness points of these systems so we could fix them.
